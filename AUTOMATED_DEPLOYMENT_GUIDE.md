# Automated Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive information about the automated deployment system implemented for the Autonomica project. The system includes automated deployment to staging and production environments with comprehensive testing, monitoring, and rollback capabilities.

## Architecture

### Deployment Flow
```
Code Push → Tests → Quality Checks → Staging Deployment → Production Deployment → Monitoring
    ↓           ↓         ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
  Develop    Linting   Security      Health Checks      Performance Tests   Alerting
  Branch     Tests     Scanning      Smoke Tests       Load Tests         Rollback
```

### Environments
- **Staging**: `develop` branch → `staging.autonomica.app`
- **Production**: `main` branch → `autonomica.app`

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Staging Deployment (`deploy-staging.yml`)

#### Triggers
- Push to `develop` branch
- Pull request to `develop` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

#### Jobs
1. **Test and Quality Checks**
   - Frontend linting and type checking
   - Backend linting and type checking
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Code coverage reporting

2. **Deploy Backend**
   - Deploy to Railway
   - Health checks
   - Wait for readiness

3. **Deploy Worker**
   - Deploy to Railway
   - Health checks
   - Wait for readiness

4. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Health checks
   - Wait for readiness

5. **Smoke Tests**
   - Test all endpoints
   - Verify service health
   - Basic functionality validation

6. **Team Notification**
   - Create GitHub issue with deployment summary
   - Success/failure status
   - Next steps and actions

#### Usage
```bash
# Manual deployment of all services
gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml

# Manual deployment of specific service
gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml --field service=frontend
gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml --field service=backend
gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml --field service=worker
```

### 2. Production Deployment (`deploy-production.yml`)

#### Triggers
- Push to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

#### Jobs
1. **Pre-deployment Checks**
   - Security scans
   - Performance tests
   - Production readiness validation
   - Environment variable verification

2. **Deploy Services**
   - Backend deployment with health checks
   - Worker deployment with health checks
   - Frontend deployment with health checks

3. **Production Tests**
   - Smoke tests
   - Load tests
   - Performance validation
   - Response time checks

4. **Post-deployment Verification**
   - Database connections
   - External service connections
   - Monitoring systems

5. **Rollback (if needed)**
   - Automatic rollback on failure
   - Rollback issue creation
   - Manual rollback commands

6. **Final Notification**
   - Success/failure summary
   - Performance metrics
   - Next steps

#### Usage
```bash
# Manual deployment with strategy
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml --field strategy=rolling
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml --field strategy=blue-green
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml --field strategy=canary

# Manual deployment of specific service
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml --field service=frontend
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml --field service=backend
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml --field service=worker
```

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Rolling Deployment (Default)
- Deploy new version alongside existing version
- Gradually shift traffic to new version
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Zero-downtime deployment

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment
- Deploy new version to separate environment
- Switch traffic when new version is ready
- Instant rollback capability
- Requires double resources during deployment

### 3. Canary Deployment
- Deploy new version to small subset of users
- Monitor performance and stability
- Gradually increase traffic to new version
- Rollback if issues detected

## Environment Configuration

### Required Secrets

#### Staging Environment
```bash
# Railway
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_railway_token

# Vercel
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token

# Database
STAGING_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Redis
STAGING_REDIS_URL=redis://...

# Authentication
STAGING_CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

#### Production Environment
```bash
# Railway
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_railway_token

# Vercel
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token

# Database
PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Redis
PRODUCTION_REDIS_URL=redis://...

# Authentication
PRODUCTION_CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_prod_...
```

### Environment Protection Rules

#### Staging
- Required reviewers: `@jairodriguez`
- Wait timer: 0 minutes
- Deployment branches: `develop`

#### Production
- Required reviewers: `@jairodriguez`
- Wait timer: 5 minutes
- Deployment branches: `main`

## Health Checks and Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints
```bash
# Frontend
GET /api/health

# Backend
GET /health

# Worker
GET /health
```

### Health Check Criteria
- **Response Time**: < 200ms (staging), < 1s (production)
- **Status Code**: 200 OK
- **Response Format**: JSON with service status
- **Dependencies**: Database, Redis, external services

### Monitoring Metrics
- Response times
- Error rates
- Throughput
- Resource usage
- Custom business metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-deployment Tests
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Service interaction testing
3. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning
4. **Performance Tests**: Basic performance validation

### Post-deployment Tests
1. **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification
2. **Health Checks**: Service availability
3. **Load Tests**: Performance under load
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow validation

### Test Automation
- Automatic test execution on deployment
- Test result reporting
- Failure notification
- Rollback triggers

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
- Triggered on deployment failure
- Health check failures
- Performance degradation
- Security scan failures

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Backend rollback
cd autonomica-api
railway rollback --service backend

# Worker rollback
cd worker
railway rollback --service worker

# Frontend rollback
cd autonomica-frontend
vercel rollback
```

### Rollback Criteria
- Service health check failures
- Performance below thresholds
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- User-reported issues
- Monitoring alert triggers

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Response Time**: API endpoint response times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Database Performance**: Query execution times

### Performance Thresholds
- **Staging**: Response time < 200ms
- **Production**: Response time < 1s
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1%
- **Uptime**: > 99.9%

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with Apache Bench
- Lighthouse performance tests
- Custom performance benchmarks
- Continuous performance monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Security Scans
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability checking
- **npm audit**: Node.js security scanning
- **CodeQL**: GitHub security analysis

### Security Measures
- Environment variable encryption
- API key rotation
- Access control and authentication
- Network security and firewalls
- Regular security audits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Deployment Failures
```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=deploy-staging.yml
gh run list --workflow=deploy-production.yml

# View detailed logs
gh run view --log <run-id>

# Retry failed deployment
gh run rerun <run-id>
```

#### 2. Health Check Failures
```bash
# Check service status
railway status
vercel ls

# View service logs
railway logs
vercel logs

# Test endpoints manually
curl -f https://staging-api.autonomica.app/health
curl -f https://autonomica.app/api/health
```

#### 3. Performance Issues
```bash
# Check response times
curl -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s "https://api.autonomica.app/health"

# Monitor resource usage
railway status --service=backend
railway status --service=worker
```

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check environment variables
gh secret list

# View secret values (admin only)
gh secret view SECRET_NAME

# Check deployment history
railway service logs
vercel ls --debug
```

## Best Practices
