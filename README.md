ü¶â OWL is a cutting-edge framework for multi-agent collaboration that pushes the boundaries of task automation, built on top of the [CAMEL-AI Framework](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel).

<!-- OWL achieves **58.18** average score on [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) benchmark and ranks üèÖÔ∏è #1 among open-source frameworks. -->

Our vision is to revolutionize how AI agents collaborate to solve real-world tasks. By leveraging dynamic agent interactions, OWL enables more natural, efficient, and robust task automation across diverse domains.

- **Browser Automation**: Utilize the Playwright framework for simulating browser interactions, including scrolling, clicking, input handling, downloading, navigation, and more.
- **Document Parsing**: Extract content from Word, Excel, PDF, and PowerPoint files, converting them into text or Markdown format.
- **Code Execution**: Write and execute Python code using interpreter.
- **Built-in Toolkits**: Access to a comprehensive set of built-in toolkits including ArxivToolkit, AudioAnalysisToolkit, CodeExecutionToolkit, DalleToolkit, DataCommonsToolkit, ExcelToolkit, GitHubToolkit, GoogleMapsToolkit, GoogleScholarToolkit, ImageAnalysisToolkit, MathToolkit, NetworkXToolkit, NotionToolkit, OpenAPIToolkit, RedditToolkit, SearchToolkit, SemanticScholarToolkit, SymPyToolkit, VideoAnalysisToolkit, WeatherToolkit, WebToolkit, and many more for specialized tasks.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd owl

# Install uv if you don't have it already
pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
# We support using Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
uv venv .venv --python=3.10

# Activate the virtual environment
# For macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install CAMEL with all dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Exit the virtual environment when done
deactivate
```

## **Setup Environment Variables** 

In the `owl/.env_template` file, you will find all the necessary API keys along with the websites where you can register for each service. To use these API services, follow these steps:

1. *Copy and Rename*: Duplicate the `.env_template` file and rename the copy to `.env`.
```bash
cp owl/.env_template .env
```
2. *Fill in Your Keys*: Open the `.env` file and insert your API keys in the corresponding fields.  (For the minimal example (`run_mini.py`), you only need to configure the LLM API key (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY).)
3. *For using more other models*: please refer to our CAMEL models docs:https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/models.html#supported-model-platforms-in-camel


> **Note**: For optimal performance, we strongly recommend using OpenAI models. Our experiments show that other models may result in significantly lower performance on complex tasks and benchmarks.

## **Running with Docker**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git
cd owl

# Configure environment variables
cp owl/.env_template owl/.env
# Edit the .env file and fill in your API keys


# Option 1: Using docker-compose directly
cd .container
docker-compose up -d
# Run OWL inside the container
docker-compose exec owl bash -c "xvfb-python run.py"

# Option 2: Build and run using the provided scripts
cd .container
chmod +x build_docker.sh
./build_docker.sh
# Run OWL inside the container
./run_in_docker.sh "your question"
```

For more detailed Docker usage instructions, including cross-platform support, optimized configurations, and troubleshooting, please refer to [DOCKER_README.md](.container/DOCKER_README_en.md).

# üöÄ Quick Start


   
Run the following demo case:

```bash
python owl/run.py
```

## Running with Different Models

OWL supports various LLM backends. You can use the following scripts to run with different models:

```bash
# Run with Qwen model
python owl/run_qwen.py

# Run with Deepseek model
python owl/run_deepseek.py

# Run with other OpenAI-compatible models
python owl/run_openai_compatiable_model.py
```

For a simpler version that only requires an LLM API key, you can try our minimal example:

```bash
python owl/run_mini.py
```

You can run OWL agent with your own task by modifying the `run.py` script:

```python
# Define your own task
question = "Task description here."

society = construct_society(question)
answer, chat_history, token_count = run_society(society)

print(f"\033[94mAnswer: {answer}\033[0m")
```

For uploading files, simply provide the file path along with your question:

```python
# Task with a local file (e.g., file path: `tmp/example.docx`)
question = "What is in the given DOCX file? Here is the file path: tmp/example.docx"

society = construct_society(question)
answer, chat_history, token_count = run_society(society)
print(f"\033[94mAnswer: {answer}\033[0m")
```

OWL will then automatically invoke document-related tools to process the file and extract the answer.


Example tasks you can try:
- "Find the latest stock price for Apple Inc."
- "Analyze the sentiment of recent tweets about climate change"
- "Help me debug this Python code: [your code here]"
- "Summarize the main points from this research paper: [paper URL]"

# üåê Web Interface

OWL now includes a web-based user interface that makes it easier to interact with the system. To start the web interface, run:

```bash
python run_app.py
```

The web interface provides the following features:

- **Easy Model Selection**: Choose between different models (OpenAI, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.)
- **Environment Variable Management**: Configure your API keys and other settings directly from the UI
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Communicate with OWL agents through a user-friendly interface
- **Task History**: View the history and results of your interactions

The web interface is built using Gradio and runs locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers beyond what's required for the model API calls you configure.

# üß™ Experiments

To reproduce OWL's GAIA benchmark score of 58.18:

1. Switch to the `gaia58.18` branch:
```bash
git checkout gaia58.18
```

1. Run the evaluation script:
```bash
python run_gaia_roleplaying.py
```

# ‚è±Ô∏è Future Plans

- [ ] Write a technical blog post detailing our exploration and insights in multi-agent collaboration in real-world tasks.
- [ ] Enhance the toolkit ecosystem with more specialized tools for domain-specific tasks.
- [ ] Develop more sophisticated agent interaction patterns and communication protocols

# ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why don't I see Chrome running locally after starting the example script?**

A: If OWL determines that a task can be completed using non-browser tools (such as search or code execution), the browser will not be launched. The browser window will only appear when OWL determines that browser-based interaction is necessary.
