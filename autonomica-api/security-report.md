# Security Audit Report for Autonomica API

## Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a security audit conducted on the `autonomica-api` codebase. The audit identified several critical architectural and security issues. Key remediation steps have already been taken, including:

1.  **Codebase Consolidation:** The two conflicting FastAPI applications (`main_api.py` and `app/main.py`) have been merged into a single, unified entrypoint at `autonomica-api/app/main.py`. This resolves significant confusion and reduces the risk of misapplied security patches.
2.  **Authentication Fix:** A critical vulnerability in the authentication middleware, which allowed for JWT token forgery by bypassing signature verification, has been patched. The middleware now uses the Clerk client for secure token validation.
3.  **Configuration Hardening:** The application's configuration has been centralized and hardened to ensure required secrets like the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` are loaded securely and validated at startup.

Despite these improvements, several vulnerabilities and areas for improvement remain. This report provides a prioritized list of actions to further enhance the security posture of the application. The most pressing remaining issue is the lack of proper multi-tenancy, which could lead to data leakage between users.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### [FIXED] JWT Signature Verification Bypass

-   **Location**: `autonomica-api/app/auth/clerk_middleware.py` (Original version)
-   **Description**: The original authentication middleware used `jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False})` to inspect the token's claims before verification. This created a critical flaw where an attacker could forge a JWT with any claims they wanted, sign it with their own key, and the application would accept it because it never verified the signature against the trusted source (Clerk).
-   **Impact**: This vulnerability allowed any unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication entirely, impersonate any user, and gain full access to the application's protected endpoints.
-   **Remediation Checklist**:
    -   [x] **DONE:** Removed the insecure `jwt.decode` call.
    -   [x] **DONE:** Implemented secure token validation using `clerk_client.verify_token(token)`, which correctly verifies the JWT signature against the public keys provided by Clerk.
    -   [x] **DONE:** Added checks to ensure the user's session is active after successful token validation.

## High Vulnerabilities

### Inadequate Multi-Tenancy and Data Isolation

-   **Location**: `autonomica-api/app/api/routes/tasks.py`, `autonomica-api/app/api/routes/agent_management.py`, `autonomica-api/app/owl/workforce.py`
-   **Description**: The application uses a global, in-memory dictionary (`tasks_storage`, `agents_db`) for storing tasks and agents. While endpoints attempt to filter data based on the authenticated user's ID, the underlying data structure is not designed for multi-tenancy. This creates a high risk of data leakage between different users if any filtering logic is missed or flawed. The refactored `main.py` notes this explicitly as a design flaw.
-   **Impact**: A malicious user could potentially access, modify, or delete tasks and agents belonging to other users. Business logic flaws could easily lead to one user's data being inadvertently exposed to another.
-   **Remediation Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Replace the in-memory dictionaries with a proper database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Design the database schema with strict data isolation, ensuring every record has a `user_id` or `tenant_id`.
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Enforce data isolation at the database level using policies (e.g., PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security) or at the ORM/query level to ensure users can only ever access their own data.
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Refactor all data access functions to require a `user_id` and include it in every query's `WHERE` clause.

### Use of Default, Insecure Secret Key

-   **Location**: `autonomica-api/app/core/config.py`
-   **Description**: The `SECRET_KEY` in the configuration has a default value of `"your-secret-key-change-in-production"`. While the configuration validation checks for this in a production environment, relying on a hardcoded, well-known default is dangerous. If the environment is misconfigured or the check fails, the application will run with a compromised key.
-   **Impact**: A compromised `SECRET_KEY` can lead to session hijacking, token forgery, and the compromise of any data protected by this key.
-   **Remediation Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Remove the default value for `SECRET_KEY`. It should *always* be loaded from an environment variable and never have a default.
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Change the `SECRET_KEY` field to `SECRET_KEY: str = Field(..., env="SECRET_KEY")` to make it a required environment variable.
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Ensure the production environment has a strong, randomly generated secret key set.

## Medium Vulnerabilities

### Sensitive Information Disclosure in Health Endpoint

-   **Location**: `autonomica-api/app/api/routes/health.py`
-   **Description**: The `/health/detailed` endpoint exposes potentially sensitive system and configuration information, such as the Python executable path, the full working directory path, and a list of enabled environment variables.
-   **Impact**: While not directly exploitable, this information provides an attacker with a detailed map of the application's environment, which can be valuable for planning further attacks.
-   **Remediation Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Restrict access to the `/health/detailed` endpoint to authenticated users with administrative privileges.
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Avoid exposing absolute file paths or a list of all environment variables. Return only the necessary, non-sensitive configuration values.
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Consider creating a separate, internal-only endpoint for detailed diagnostics.

### In-Memory Storage for Production Data

-   **Location**: `autonomica-api/app/api/routes/tasks.py`, `agent_management.py`
-   **Description**: The application uses global dictionaries (`tasks_storage`, `agents_db`) as its data store. This is not suitable for a production environment.
-   **Impact**: All data is lost upon application restart. This solution does not scale, is not performant under load, and makes data management and security significantly more difficult.
-   **Remediation Checklist**:
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Migrate all in-memory storage to a robust, production-grade database system as mentioned in the multi-tenancy vulnerability.
    -   [ ] **TODO:** Implement proper data access layers (repositories or services) to handle interactions with the new database.

## General Security Recommendations

-   [ ] **Implement Input Validation:** None of the Pydantic models in the route files appear to have input validation beyond basic type checking. Implement strict validation for all user-supplied data (e.g., string length, character sets, numerical ranges) using Pydantic validators to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
-   [ ] **Refactor Route Files:** The API route files (`workflows.py`, `tasks.py`, etc.) still rely on a problematic global singleton pattern (`get_workforce`) to access the `Workforce` instance. These should be refactored to get the `Workforce` instance from the application state, consistent with the new architecture in `app/main.py`. Example: `workforce: Workforce = Depends(get_workforce_from_state)`.
-   [ ] **Add Security Headers:** While some security headers are present, ensure that a comprehensive set of headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`) are applied to all responses to protect against attacks like clickjacking and XSS.
-   [ ] **Implement Comprehensive Logging:** Enhance logging to include security-relevant events, such as failed login attempts, access denied errors, and validation failures. Ensure logs are stored securely and are regularly monitored.
-   [ ] **Conduct Regular Dependency Scans:** Integrate a dependency scanning tool (e.g., `pip-audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and report on vulnerable dependencies.

## Security Posture Improvement Plan

1.  **Priority 1 (Critical):** Implement proper multi-tenancy and data isolation by migrating from in-memory storage to a secure database. This is the most significant remaining risk.
2.  **Priority 2 (High):** Remove the default `SECRET_KEY` and enforce its presence through environment variables.
3.  **Priority 3 (Medium):** Secure the `/health/detailed` endpoint and remove sensitive information from its response.
4.  **Priority 4 (Recommended):** Refactor all remaining route files to align with the new dependency injection pattern established in `app/main.py`.
5.  **Priority 5 (Recommended):** Implement strict input validation across all Pydantic models and add comprehensive security headers.
