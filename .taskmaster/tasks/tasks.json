Configure Clerk providers in `app/layout.tsx`:\n   ```typescript\n   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'\n\n   export default function RootLayout({\n     children,\n   }: {\n     children: React.ReactNode\n   }) {\n     return (\n       <ClerkProvider>\n         <html lang=\"en\">\n           <body>{children}</body>\n         </html>\n       </ClerkProvider>\n     )\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:\n   ```\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key\n   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key\n   ```\n\n4. Implement login/logout components:\n   - Create `components/Auth/SignInButton.tsx`\n   - Create `components/Auth/UserButton.tsx`\n\n5. Add authentication to the dark-themed interface:\n   - Update `app/page.tsx` to include SignInButton or UserButton\n   - Style components to match the dark theme\n\n6. Protect routes that require authentication:\n   - Create `middleware.ts` in the root directory:\n     ```typescript\n     import { authMiddleware } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\n     \n     export default authMiddleware({\n       publicRoutes: [\"/\", \"/api/public\"]\n     });\n     \n     export const config = {\n       matcher: ['/((?!.+\\\\.[\\\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],\n     };\n     ```\n\n7. Integrate user context with project management features:\n   - Use `useUser` hook from Clerk in components that need user data\n   - Update API calls to include user token for authentication\n\n8. Implement role-based access control:\n   - Define user roles (e.g., admin, manager, user)\n   - Create a custom hook `useUserRole` to determine user's role\n   - Use role information to conditionally render UI elements\n\n9. Add error handling and loading states:\n   - Create `components/Auth/AuthLoading.tsx` for loading state\n   - Implement error messages for failed authentication attempts\n\n10. Optimize authentication state persistence:\n    - Configure Clerk to use JWT for stateless authentication\n    - Implement secure token storage and refresh mechanisms\n<info added on 2025-06-19T18:45:48.791Z>\n## Implementation Progress Update\n\n### Completed Tasks\n1. Successfully installed @clerk/nextjs package\n2. Configured ClerkProvider in app/layout.tsx with updated metadata\n3. Implemented dark-themed authentication components:\n   - UserButton: Custom dark-themed component with user information display\n   - SignInButton: Purple-themed button matching the interface design\n   - AuthLoading: Dark-themed loading state component\n4. Enhanced homepage with authentication integration:\n   - Added navigation bar with conditional authentication display\n   - Implemented protected Projects link with lock icon for unauthenticated users\n   - Applied full dark theme (gray-900/800/700 palette with purple accents)\n   - Added TypeScript types for chat handlers\n5. Created middleware.ts with clerkMiddleware to protect /projects routes\n6. Updated component exports to include authentication components\n7. Created .env.example with Clerk configuration template\n\n### Technical Implementation Details\n- Utilized latest Clerk API (clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher)\n- Applied consistent dark theme styling to match existing interface\n- Implemented protected routes with authentication requirements\n- Added conditional rendering based on authentication state\n- Incorporated proper loading states and error handling\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Set up Clerk account and add API keys to .env.local\n2. Test authentication flow and route protection\n3. Integrate with backend API to include user tokens\n4. Validate the complete authentication experience\n</info added on 2025-06-19T18:45:48.791Z>",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit test authentication components:\n   - Test SignInButton and UserButton render correctly\n   - Verify UserButton displays correct user information when logged in\n\n2. Integration test protected routes:\n   - Attempt to access protected routes without authentication\n   - Verify redirect to login page for unauthenticated users\n   - Test successful access to protected routes after authentication\n\n3. End-to-end test authentication flow:\n   - Use Playwright to simulate user sign-up, login, and logout processes\n   - Verify persistence of authentication state across page reloads\n\n4. Test role-based access control:\n   - Create test users with different roles\n   - Verify that UI elements and routes are correctly restricted based on user role\n\n5. Performance testing:\n   - Measure impact of authentication on initial page load time\n   - Test token refresh mechanism to ensure seamless user experience\n\n6. Security testing:\n   - Attempt to bypass authentication using expired or invalid tokens\n   - Verify that sensitive routes are not accessible via direct URL manipulation\n\n7. Cross-browser testing:\n   - Verify authentication works consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge\n\n8. Mobile responsiveness:\n   - Test authentication UI on various mobile devices and screen sizes\n\n9. Error handling:\n   - Simulate network errors during authentication process\n   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed to the user\n\n10. Accessibility testing:\n    - Use aXe or similar tools to ensure authentication components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards",
