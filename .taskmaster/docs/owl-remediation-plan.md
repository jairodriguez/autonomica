# OWL Project Remediation Plan

## Overview

This remediation plan addresses the critical security vulnerabilities and usability issues identified in the OWL (Optimized Workforce Learning) project audit. The plan is structured in phases with clear priorities, timelines, and success criteria.

## Phase 1: Emergency Security Fixes (Week 1-2)

### Priority: CRITICAL - Security Vulnerabilities

#### 1.1 Remote Code Execution Fix
**Issue**: Dynamic module import vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution

**Actions**:
- [ ] Create whitelist of allowed modules in `owl/webapp.py`
- [ ] Replace `importlib.import_module()` with static imports
- [ ] Implement module validation function
- [ ] Add security logging for module access attempts

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Replace this vulnerable code:
module_path = f"examples.{example_module}"
module = importlib.import_module(module_path)

# With secure whitelist approach:
ALLOWED_MODULES = {
    "run", "run_mini", "run_gemini", "run_claude",
    "run_deepseek_zh", "run_qwen_zh", "run_terminal_zh"
}

if example_module not in ALLOWED_MODULES:
    raise ValueError(f"Module {example_module} not allowed")

# Use static imports or module mapping
module_map = {
    "run": run_module,
    "run_mini": run_mini_module,
    # ... etc
}
module = module_map[example_module]
```

**Owner**: Security Team
**Timeline**: 2 days
**Success Criteria**: No dynamic imports, whitelist validation working

#### 1.2 Environment Variable Exposure Fix
**Issue**: API keys displayed in plain text in web interface

**Actions**:
- [ ] Mask sensitive values in `update_env_table()` function
- [ ] Create separate view/edit modes for environment variables
- [ ] Implement value masking (show only first/last 4 characters)
- [ ] Add role-based access control for sensitive operations

**Code Changes**:
```python
def mask_sensitive_value(key, value):
    """Mask sensitive environment variable values"""
    if is_api_related(key):
        if len(value) > 8:
            return value[:4] + "****" + value[-4:]
        else:
            return "****"
    return value
```

**Owner**: Security Team
**Timeline**: 3 days

```

**Owner**: UX Team
**Timeline**: 3 days
**Success Criteria**: Error messages provide actionable solutions, user satisfaction with error handling increases by 70%

        return False, "Question cannot be empty"

    if len(question) > 10000:  # Reasonable limit
        return False, "Question too long (max 10000 characters)"

    # Check for suspicious patterns
    suspicious_patterns = [
        r'<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>',  # XSS
        r'union\s+select.*--',  # SQL injection
        r';\s*rm\s+-rf',  # Command injection

    # Normalize path to prevent traversal
    normalized_path = os.path.normpath(filepath)

    # Check for directory traversal attempts
    if '..' in normalized_path or not normalized_path.startswith('/allowed/directory'):
        return False

    # Check file extension against whitelist
    allowed_extensions = {'.txt', '.md', '.json', '.csv'}
